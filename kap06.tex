\section{mastermind-with-a-linear-number-of-queries}
 - strategy for O(n) queries for determining the secret code in the adaptive form. They dont prove it for deterministic (static) variation - could be me.

Variations of Mastermind have furthermore been proposed to model problems in security,
such as revealing someoneâ€™s identity by making queries to a genomic database [7], and API-based
attacks to determine bank PINs [6].

\section{Solving_Static_Permutation_Mastermind_2022}
Theoretical proof for static permutation mastermind using O(nlogn) queries. It could be reconstructed.

There probably isnt a solution to static mastermind c <= p in O(nlogn).
