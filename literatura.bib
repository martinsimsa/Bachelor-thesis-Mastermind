abstract = {We present a new genetic algorithm for playing the game of Mastermind. The algorithm requires low run-times and results in a low expected number of guesses. Its performance is comparable to that of other meta-heuristics for the standard setting with four positions and six colors, while it outperforms the existing algorithms when more colors and positions are examined. The central idea underlying the algorithm is the creation of a large set of eligible guesses collected throughout the different generations of the genetic algorithm, the quality of each of which is subsequently determined based on a comparison with a selection of elements of the set.}

A code C is reduced if it contains the all-zero vector. For n large enough the metrical rigidity of length n reduced binary codes containing a 2-(n,k,λ)-design is proved. The class of such codes includes all the families of uniformly packed codes of sufficiently large length satisfying the condition d-ρ ≥ 2, where d is the code distance and ρ is the covering radius.}

He had fought the instinct of telling him how to better spend his life, just limiting to look at him in disgust long enough to be certain to be noticed. No wonder when the next day the director fell on his chair astonished while reading, on the newspaper, about a huge digital fraud on the ATMs of his bank, with millions of Euros stolen by a team of hackers all around the world. The article mentioned how the hackers had 'played with the bank computers just like playing Mastermind', being able to disclose thousands of user PINs during the one-hour lunch break. That precise moment, a second before falling senseless, he understood the subtle smile on Joe's face the day before, while training at his preferred game, Mastermind.},

AB  - In this paper we formally prove that the problem of cracking, i.e., correctly guessing, bank PINs used for accessing Automated Teller Machines and the problem of solving the Generalized Mastermind Game are strictly related. The Generalized Mastermind Game with N colors and k pegs is an extension of the well known Mastermind game, played with 6 colors and 4 pegs. The rules are the same, one player has to conceal a sequence of k colored pegs behind a screen and another player has to guess the exact position and colors of the pegs using the minimal number of moves. We first introduce a general game, called the Extended Mastermind Game (EMG), and we then formally prove it includes both the Generalized Mastermind Game and the PIN cracking Problem. We then present some experimental results that we have devised using a computer program that optimizes a well known technique presented by Knuth in 1976 for the standard Mastermind game. We finally show that the program improves the as state-of-the-art Mastermind solvers as it is able to compute strategies for cases which were not yet covered. More interestingly, the same solving strategy is adapted also for the solution of the PIN cracking problem.
